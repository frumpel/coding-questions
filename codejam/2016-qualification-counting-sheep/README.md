[Problem statement](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6254486/dashboard) 
I was curious about google's code jam and had no real time to commit to this. Basically this was just a brute force experiment on how to participate at all.

* In the process (sheep-proof.txt) verified that the only INSOMNIA case is the number 0, so the code could be optimized by simply checking for 0 up front. 
* Open question: what is the maximum number of iterations required to determine that number. Based on the numbers from 1-9 I would expect it to be 44.
